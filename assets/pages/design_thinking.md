# What are we doing now?

We are in ***Discovery*** phase of *"Design Thinking" methodology...

- Design Thinking is a solution-focused discipline that aims to match a customer’s needs with well-designed, technologically feasible solutions.
- Design Thinking, on the other hand, is all about dreaming big and imagining what could be, then transforming these dreams into technologically feasible solutions.


# Steps in the Discovery phase?
1. Define Problem
    - When 
    - What 
    - Who
    - Where 
    - How 
    - Why
    - What problem are we trying to solve?
    - How do we know this is a real problem?
    - Why is it important to solve?
    - Who are our users? What are their goals and motivations?
    - How will we know if we’ve solved the problem?
    - “How Might We” Questions
    - *Affinity Diagrams?

    - PROBLEM STATEMENT FORMAT
        - [The name of your proto-persona]
        - needs a way to [user’s need]
        - because [insight].
        - We will know this to be true when we see [this quantitative / qualitative measure].
