# What are we doing now?

We are in ***Discovery*** phase of ***Design Thinking philosophy***.     

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/design_thinking_process.jpg)

- Design Thinking is a solution-focused discipline that aims to match a customer’s needs with well-designed, technologically feasible solutions.
- Design Thinking, on the other hand, is all about dreaming big and imagining what could be, then transforming these dreams into technologically feasible solutions.

<a name="Discovery_phase"></a>
### Steps in the Discovery phase?
1. Define Problem
    - What problem are we trying to solve?
    - How do we know this is a real problem?
    - Why is it important to solve?
    - Who are our users? What are their goals and motivations?
    - How will we know if we’ve solved the problem?
    - “How Might We” Questions
    - *Affinity Diagrams?

### 1. Image based crops readiness for Potato farm.

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/potato/potato1.jpg)

1. Asking the right questions
    - What
        - Potato crop readiness prediction
    - Why
        - manual resource heavy process 
        - regular manual monitoring
        - unpredictable weather and raining conditions
        - leads less productive and to heavy losses 
    - Who
        - farmer
        - farming firms
        - Agriculture Insurance companies
    - How
        - AI - Image processing
        - Smartphone based app
        - historic data
        - crop file cycle insights
        - proactive alerts 
        - ***more productive*** with ***fewer resources and monitoring***          

1. Persona
    - Proto persona: ***the farmer - Markus***
    - ![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/persona.jpg)

1. Problem Statement
    - Markus needs a way to automate monitoring of crops readiness. Currently this is very manual process as he needs to visit farm every time.  
    - We need to enable Markus to monitor his potato corps from remote location using his smartphone like device. He even empowered with timely insights and alerts for crop readiness. 

1. Research Based Method (research dataset)
    - Question for research script
        1. Potato farming in Germany, facts.
        2. How potato farming done today; organic / conventional?
        3. How to identify if crop is ready?
        4. How much loses happen due to "false crop readiness"?
        5. Why dose loses happen?
